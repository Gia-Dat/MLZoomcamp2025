# Animal Classification System

## Description

### Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to build a robust classifier that can handle real-world images of animals.
With this system, it can helps a lot in providing teaching assistant, or scientific work

### Solution Approach

This project implements a machine learning pipeline:
1. Animal Classification: Using CNNs model
2. Deployment: Deploy a web service for education or scientific work

## Instruction on How to Run Project

### Preparing the dataset:

1. Go to the dataset link on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/
2. Create a notebook and run the code including in subset.ipynb to have a small subset of that dataset

Run the code 3 times for train, validation, test parts
*If you don't want to start from scratch I also included it in the data folder*
